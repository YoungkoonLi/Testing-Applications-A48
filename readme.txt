Make sure Graphmaker.c and A3-interactive_driver.c are in the same directory. Compile A3-interactive_driver.c to get the executable.

How to test:
Use option 19 and 20 to generate a user file and graph file. 
use option 10 and 11 to load in the same file you just generated. You should load the brand first.
Now, you can use other options to change the state of the graph, i.e. follow/unfollow users and brands.
You can also test get degrees connection.
Lastly you can output the user into file using option 22.

Note that this program does not test the correctness of your graffit.c, it only generates data for it, change the data generated using functions from 
graffit.c, and outputs the date in ways. You can compare your output with others given the same changes are made to the same data generated.

Make sure to change MAT_SIZE if you want to create a larger brand matrix.
